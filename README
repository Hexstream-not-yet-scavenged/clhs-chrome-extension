INCOMPLETE. BROKEN. ABANDONED.


Bundles a full and unmodified copy of the Common Lisp HyperSpec
for fast local browsing, even when offline.

This extension is not affiliated with LispWorks.


Although the final release would include the CLHS, this repository does not include it.
You need to extract or symlink the HyperSpec-7-0 directory at the root of the project.
You also need to extract or symlink global.hexstreamsoft.com in libraries/global.hexstreamsoft.com/.
You also need to manually install 2 images in the images directory, see README there for details.

Things will be quite broken anyway, though. I don't have time to revisit and fix this codebase.
